# Search Content Function Logging Improvement

## Overview

Improved the logging structure in the search-content edge function by adding consistent step-type prefixes to all log statements. This enhancement significantly improves log readability and debugging capabilities.

## Changes Made

### Before
Logs used generic prefixes like:
- `🔍 Processing query: "..."`
- `❌ OpenAI API error: ...`
- `🖼️ Fetching poster for: ...`

### After
Logs now use consistent step-type prefixes:
- `[Request] 🔍 Processing query: "..."`
- `[OpenAI] ❌ API error: ...`
- `[TMDB] 🖼️ Fetching poster for: ...`

## Log Prefixes Used

| Prefix | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `[Request]` | Initial request processing and validation | Processing query, parameter validation |
| `[Extract]` | URL content extraction when URL is detected | Fetching URL content, HTML parsing |
| `[OpenAI]` | OpenAI API interactions for content identification | API calls, responses, errors |
| `[Parse]` | Parsing OpenAI JSON responses | JSON parsing, data validation, error handling |
| `[Streaming]` | Processing streaming sources | Source generation, service detection |
| `[TMDB]` | TMDB API interactions for poster fetching | Poster searches, metadata retrieval |
| `[Response]` | Final response preparation | Result compilation, success logging |
| `[Error]` | Global error handling | Unhandled exceptions, system errors |

## Example Log Output

```
[Request] 🔍 Processing query: "Inception movie"
[OpenAI] 🤖 Identifying content with OpenAI...
[Parse] 📝 Attempting to parse: {"title": "Inception"...
[Streaming] 📊 Processing 3 streaming sources from OpenAI
[TMDB] 🖼️ Fetching poster for: Inception
[TMDB] ✅ Found poster for Inception
[Response] ✅ Returning 1 results
```

## URL Processing Example

When processing URLs, additional extraction logs are shown:

```
[Request] 🔍 Processing query: "https://www.netflix.com/title/70131314"
[Extract] 🌐 URL detected, fetching content...
[OpenAI] 🤖 Identifying content with OpenAI...
[Parse] 📝 Attempting to parse: {"title": "Inception"...
[Streaming] 📊 Processing 1 streaming sources from OpenAI
[TMDB] 🖼️ Fetching poster for: Inception
[TMDB] ✅ Found poster for Inception
[Response] ✅ Returning 1 results
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Debugging**: Easily identify which service/step is causing issues
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track how long each step takes by looking at timestamps
3. **Clear Flow Visualization**: Understand the complete request flow at a glance
4. **Service-Specific Filtering**: Filter logs by prefix to focus on specific services
5. **Consistent Format**: All log statements follow the same `[Step] emoji message` pattern

## Compatibility

- Maintains all existing emoji indicators for visual clarity
- No breaking changes to function behavior
- Compatible with existing log monitoring and analysis tools
- All log levels (info, warning, error) use consistent prefixes

## Usage in Production

The improved logging will help with:
- Monitoring API response times by service
- Identifying bottlenecks in the content identification pipeline
- Debugging failed requests by tracking exactly where they fail
- Understanding usage patterns across different services

## File Modified

- `/supabase/functions/search-content/index.ts` - Updated all console.log and console.error statements with step prefixes

## Testing

Tested locally with:
1. Text query: `"Inception movie"`
2. URL query: `"https://www.netflix.com/title/70131314"`

Both scenarios show clear, step-prefixed logging throughout the entire request flow.
